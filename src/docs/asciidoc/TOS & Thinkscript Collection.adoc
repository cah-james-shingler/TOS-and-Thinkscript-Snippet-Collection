== Preface

The "TOS and Thinkscript Snippet Collection" by http://mytrade.com/StanL[Stanl]
has been a great help in my thinkscript development journey.  I constantly look
to this work for ideas and techniques.

It appears that "TOS and Thinkscript Snippet Collection" hasn't been update in
3 years as of this writing, ...  I am not sure if something happened to StanL or what.

*My Motivations:*  I found the pdf hard to read at times and I want the great work
StanL did to live on.  So I converted the PDF to Asciidoctor html format.
https://github.com/jshingler/TOS-and-Thinkscript-Snippet-Collection[TOS-and-Thinkscript-Snippet-Collection].

As converting from PDF is a lot of work, ... This is a work in
process and I will continue to work on the formatting and clean up.

Please feel free to fork and send me pull requests or corrections and additions.
